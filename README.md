# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

###Project goal

This project is part of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" Coursera course, taught by John Hopkins University. Its purpose is "to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis."

###Project requirements

The required steps in the project are as follows:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

###Project output

* The independent tidy data set mentioned in point 5 above is run_analysis.txt.
* The code file that fulfills the requirements is run_analysis.R.
* The code book where details about where can the raw data be found and what transformations have been made to it to arrive to the final result can be found in Codebook.md
